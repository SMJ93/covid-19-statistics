# Covid-19 Statistics üìä

The purpose of this web app is to provide up to date Covid-19 statistics, including deaths per capita.

Special thanks to [about-corona.net](https://about-corona.net/documentation) for their api.

## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

- Refactor `AllCountriesTable` into separate components
- Country screen
- Make it look pretty

## Running locally

### `yarn`

Installs dependencies in the local node_modules folder.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deployments

### `yarn deploy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

To deploy the app we use [Firebase deploy](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/deploying).

Once deployed, the updates will be visible here:
